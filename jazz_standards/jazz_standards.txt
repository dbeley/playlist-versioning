like someone in love
autumn leaves
stompin' at the savoy
there will never be another you
oleo
solar
they can't take that away from me
beautiful love
girl from ipanema
the girl from ipanema

the nearness of you
watermelon man
yardbird suite
moon river
st. thomas
song for my father
on the sunny side of the street
moanin
it might as well be spring

a foggy day
i mean you
georgia on my mind
it could happen to you
it had to be you
joy spring
cantaloupe island
billie's bounce
it don't mean a thing
blue bossa
footprints
i got rhythm
moment's notice
now's the time
take five
take the a train
take the "a" train
after you've gone
after you have gone
i'll be seeing you
god bless the child
moonlight in vermont
billy boy
crazy he calls me
danny boy
(put another nickel in) music, music, music
someone to watch over me
body and soul
body & soul
anything goes
del sasser

i'll remember april
in a sentimental mood
mack the knife
my foolish heart

polka dots & moonbeams
polkadots & moonbeams
polka dots and moonbeams
polkadots and moonbeams
softly as in a morning sunrise
since i fell for you
the way you look tonight
just friends
straight no chaser
straight, no chaser
almost like being in love
giant steps
so what
get happy
tea for two
sing, sing, sing (with a swing)
st. louis blues
all of me
fly me to the moon
all the things you are
my favorite things
summertime
round midnight
blue monk
cherokee
a night in tunisia
dolphin dance
donna lee
my funny valentine
on green dolphin street
it's a raggy waltz
blue rondo a la turk
blue rondo Ã  la turk
everything happens to me
someday my prince will come
