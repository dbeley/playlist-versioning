like someone in love
autumn leaves
stompin' at the savoy
there will never be another you
oleo
solar
they can't take that away from me
beautiful love
girl from ipanemo
wave
corcovado
i concentrate on you
the nearness of you
watermelon man
yardbird suite
moon river
st. thomas
song for my father
on the sunny side of the street
moanin
moanin'
it might as well be spring
have you met miss jones
a foggy day
i mean you
georgia on my mind
it could happen to you
it had to be you
joy spring
cantaloupe island
billie's bounce
it don't mean a thing (if it ain't got that swing)
