like someone in love
autumn leaves
stompin' at the savoy
there will never be another you
oleo
solar
they can't take that away from me
beautiful love
girl from ipanemo
wave
corcovado
i concentrate on you
the nearness of you
watermelon man
yardbird suite
moon river
st. thomas
song for my father
on the sunny side of the street
moanin
it might as well be spring
have you met miss jones
a foggy day
i mean you
georgia on my mind
it could happen to you
it had to be you
joy spring
cantaloupe island
billie's bounce
it don't mean a thing
blue bossa
footprints
i got rhythm
moment's notice
now's the time
take five
take the a train
after you've gone
after you have gone
i'll be seeing you
god bless the child
moonlight in vermont
billy boy
crazy he calls me
danny boy
(put another nickel in) music, music, music
someone to watch over me
body and soul
body & soul
anything goes
del sasser
orange colored sky
stella by starlight
this i dig of you
misty
i'll remember april
in a sentimental mood
mack the knife
my foolish heart
nardis
polka dots & moonbeams
polkadots & moonbeams
polka dots and moonbeams
polkadots and moonbeams
softly as in a morning sunrise
since i fell for you
the way you look tonight
